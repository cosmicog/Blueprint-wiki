Launchers require a set of XMLs for the icon pack to work properly. I will just mention them here. To know how to "write" them or their structure, check the files already included.


**First set**

These files are in `app/src/main/assets/` folder:
- app_func_theme.xml
- appfilter.xml
- desk.xml
- drawable.xml
- themecfg.xml
- themefont.ttf (Notice this is a font file).
- themeinfo.xml

---

**Second set**

These files must be in `app/src/main/res/xml/` folder.
- appfilter.xml
- appmap.xml
- drawable.xml
- noshader.xml
- theme_resources.xml
- themecfg.xml
- themeinfo.xml

---

**As you can see, some files are in 2 folders. They are the exact same files, you don't need to modify them, just copy and paste them in the other folders.**

---

Finally, I want to mention that some of these files doesn't really need to be edited (but they need to be added) so you can keep them exactly the same as I share them. Those files are:
- app_func_theme.xml
- desk.xml
- noshader.xml

**Be sure to edit and check the other files. Otherwise you may get info from my icon pack Ertz in your app, which are the sample files I added.**
