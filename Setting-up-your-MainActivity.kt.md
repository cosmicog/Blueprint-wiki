After you have imported your project successfully, go to the java files and edit `MainActivity.kt`, which is located at `app/src/main/kotlin/your.package.name/`

## You will find these lines there:
```kotlin
/**
 * You can choose between:
 * - DrawerBlueprintActivity
 * - BottomNavigationBlueprintActivity
 */
class MainActivity:BottomNavigationBlueprintActivity() {
    /**
     * These things here have the default values. You can delete the ones you don't want to change
     * and/or modify the ones you want to.
     */
    override var donationsEnabled = true
    
    override fun amazonInstallsEnabled():Boolean = false
    override fun checkLPF():Boolean = true
    override fun checkStores():Boolean = true
    
    /**
     * This is your app's license key. Get yours on Google Play Dev Console.
     * Default one isn't valid and could cause issues in your app.
     */
    override fun getLicKey():String? = "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiGgKglYGYGihLuihUuhhuBlouBkuiuBIyvYV"
    
    /**
     * This is the license checker code. Feel free to create your own implementation or
     * leave it as it is.
     * Anyways, keep the 'destroyChecker()' as the very first line of this code block
     * Return null to disable license check
     */
    override fun getLicenseChecker():PiracyChecker? {
        destroyChecker() // Important
        if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) return null
        return super.getLicenseChecker()
    }
    
    /**
     * This is needed by the app. Do NOT edit it. Do NOT delete it.
     */
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState:Bundle?) = super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    }

## What does every line do?
```kotlin
override var donationsEnabled = true
```
If you plan to provide in-app purchases, keep this function unchanged, otherwise set it to `false`.
If it is set to `true`, be sure that you [enable the required permission](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Frames/wiki/Setting-up-AndroidManifest.xml#enabling-donations) in `AndroidManifest.xml`

Also, if you want to enable donations, you must add your license key too, otherwise they won't work.

```kotlin
override fun amazonInstallsEnabled():Boolean = false
```
If you plan to distribute your app in the Amazon's Appstore, change this function to `true`, instead of `false`.

```kotlin
override fun checkLPF():Boolean = true
```
If you want the License Checker to check whether user has **Lucky Patcher** installed and prevent him from using your app until he uninstalls it, keep this function unchanged, otherwise set it to `false`.

```kotlin
override fun checkStores():Boolean = true
```
If you want the License Checker to check whether user has installed 3rd party stores that let people download pirated apps  (such as **Aptoide** or **BlackMarket**) and prevent him from using your app until he uninstalls it, keep this function unchanged, otherwise set it to `false`.

```kotlin
override fun getLicKey():String? = "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiGgKglYGYGihLuihUuhhuBlouBkuiuBIyvYV"
```
If your app is going to be paid, you may want to enable the **License Checker**. In order to make it work, you need to paste an API key into this function. The API key gets generated by Dev Console right after creating app page. You can find it by going to your app's page (in Dev Console), then click `Development tools` tab and you should see a link to `Services and APIs`. You can find your API key in this page, then copy it and replace `"MIIBIjANBgkqhkiGgKglYGYGihLuihUuhhuBlouBkuiuBIyvYV"` with your key. **Don't forget to put it in quotes**.



## Switching from Bottom Navigation to Navigation Drawer
Blueprint's default navigation method is bottom navigation. If you'd to change it to a navigation drawer, edit the following file:
```kotlin
class MainActivity:BottomNavigationBlueprintActivity() {
```
As stated in the file's comments, you just need to change `BottomNavigationBlueprintActivity` to `DrawerBlueprintActivity`.
After this change, your code should look like this:
```kotlin
class MainActivity:DrawerBlueprintActivity() {
```
